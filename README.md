There are 5 blocks in this workflow.

2. Store Company Details - Store Company Details.txt to google drive
3. Chat with RAG agent - Chat with OpenAI Model (using gpt-5-mini for chat and gpt-4o-mini for analysis, text-embadding-3-small for vector database)
4. Store Final Report - Store Sales Prepartion Report.txt to google drive
5. Store embeddings in vectors - Store generated Report to vector database

## Folders explanations

1. input: input of workflow
   Sales Preparation Report Template.pdf : processed by embedding model and stores in pinecone vector database, this template will
   be used as a reference template for each task.

2. output: output of workflow : the folder structure of google drive, the folder structure is same as google drive folder structure

- "Sales Preparation Report - Google" folder:
  This folder was generated on the fly based on user chat input.
  For example, when user type "Create/Generate me a Sales Preparation Report for <Company Name>, Website <Company Official Site>"
  Workflow will take the part after "for" and before next "," as the Company Name, it will then generate this folder on the fly.

  - "Company Details - Google.txt" : formatted results of company enrich process, stores in the same folder of current task,
    stored for reference, incase sales person would like to refine the Preparation report. The file was generated a .txt file for easy to read
    by non technicals.
  - "Sales Preparation Report - Google.txt": The final report generated by the workflow. The file was generated a .txt file for easy to read
    by non technicals.
